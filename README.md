# Cryptogram Solver
### A substitution cipher solver built with python.

A ‘cryptoquip’ or ‘cryptogram’ is a substitution cipher, commonly found in newspapers, where a cipher is accompanied by a pair of starter clue letters weilding a one-to-one relationship between the cipher and the solution and the reverse relationship is not necessarily true. Any approach to a solution involves sound deduction or trial and error.
